In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's rendered conditionally.  If the component isn't initially rendered (e.g., based on a conditional render, a loading state, or an authentication check), `useParams` might return `undefined`, causing errors later when trying to access its properties.  This leads to runtime errors and unpredictable behavior.
